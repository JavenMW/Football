# Football Game Margin Predictor

**Predict NFL game margins and identify value bets with data-driven modeling**

## Overview
This project builds a complete end-to-end ML solution to predict point spread (margin) in NFL games. It includes data collection, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and deployment via an APIâ€”showcasing a production-ready workflow for predictive modeling.

## Project Flow
1. **Data Understanding** (`2_Data_Understanding`)   
   - Collected data from three different sources into a materialized view consisting of 6988 rows and 370 features.
   - Analyzed 25 years of historical football data to uncover trends seen with a games margin.
   - Explore historical game data: correlations, distributions, feature relationships.

3. **Data Preparation** (`3_Data_Preparation`)  
   - Clean data, select relevant features, and scale numeric features.
   - Replaced nulls with averages for the given position if the data was missing and 0 if there was no data found.

4. **Modeling & Evaluation** (`4_5_Modeling_and_Evaluation`)  
   Train and tune Lasso regression using sklearn pipelines.  
   Evaluate with MAE, RMSE, RÂ², and residual analysis using test data.
   Back tested on previous seasons to simulate live predictions.
   

5. **Deployment** (`6_Deployment`)  
   Package the trained pipeline into a FastAPI application that serves predictions to a Next.js frontend.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages & Libraries**: Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn  
- **API**: FastAPI for model serving  
- **Deployment**: Render (Backend), Vercel (Frontend)  
- **Dependencies**: See `requirements.txt`

NOTE: If the app goes inactive, there will be a cold startup period of around 60 seconds, after that predictions should works instantly. 

## ðŸ“Š Results & Impact
- **Test Accuracy**: Predictions within Â±0.5 points for 75% of sample games.  
- **Model Strength**: On par with bookmaker spreads in predictive consistency.  
- **Explainability**: Coefficients from the Lasso model are used to explain model predictions.
